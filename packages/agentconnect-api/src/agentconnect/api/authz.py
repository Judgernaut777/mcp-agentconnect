"""HTTP authentication and authorization.

The transport authenticates. `AgentConnectService.authorize` decides. Nothing in
this module contains a policy rule — it turns a request into `(token, action,
task_id, review_id)` and hands that to the service, which owns every rule.

Two properties are worth stating because they are easy to lose:

**The route table is exhaustive by construction.** A route with no entry in
`ROUTE_ACTIONS` is refused with 500 rather than served, so adding a route without
deciding its action fails loudly instead of shipping an open door. A startup test
asserts the table covers the app.

**The actor is the token, never the body.** A caller who says
``{"completed_by": "matthew"}`` is making a claim about identity, and a claim is
not a credential. Handlers read `request.state.principal.actor`.
