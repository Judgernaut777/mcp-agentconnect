"""The authoritative catalog of MCP tools, and the action each one needs.

**This module is the single source of truth.** `agentconnect-mcp` registers exactly
these tools, `workspace.mcp_config` advertises exactly these names, and a test
asserts both. Before this existed there were two hand-written lists that had drifted:
`.mcp.json` advertised `get_subtask_status`, which no server registered, and omitted
eight tools that were registered — including every memory tool. A catalog nobody
generates is a catalog nobody keeps.

`core` cannot import `agentconnect-mcp` (the dependency runs the other way), so the
list lives here and the server imports it. That direction is deliberate: the ledger
decides what may be done to it, and a transport may only expose a subset.

Each tool names the action `AgentConnectService.authorize` is asked about. The action
is not the tool name — `get_status` the tool asks about `get_status` the action, but
`open_task` asks about `get_task` — because actions are ledger operations and several
tools may reach the same one.
