"""The provider-neutral observation event model (production handoff Part III).

AgentConnect owns this vocabulary. A lifecycle change in `AgentConnectService`
is translated into exactly one :class:`AgentObservationEvent`, and that event is
handed to zero or more configured providers. No provider ever sees an
AgentConnect model object; it sees this normalized shape. That is what lets a
tmux pane, a JSONL line, and an OTLP span all carry the *same* correlation ids.

Two rules the model enforces by construction:

* **No hidden chain-of-thought.** There is no field for a prompt, a completion,
  or an agent's reasoning. `metadata` is for provider-native *state names* and
  small scalars, never transcripts. Sensitive capture is opt-in and travels a
  different, redacted path — never this event.
* **Correlation without timestamp guessing.** Every event carries the full id
  set (`trace_id`, `task_id`, `delegation_id`, `parent_delegation_id`,
  `subtask_id`, `session_id`, `run_id`, `review_id`), so a tree or a trace is
  reconstructable from the events alone.
